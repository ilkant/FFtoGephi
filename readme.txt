Here is two python tools to get names and cM values to matches from FTDNA FF match list.

First download from FTDNA FF-matches list to your computer as filename.csv. Then you can make two files from it.
So you can import them to Gephi. First is namelist and second is list of links with cM weights. Import spreadsheet
and it imports these csv-files. Both separate. Names to Nodes and Links to Links.

Usage: python FFtoGephiN.py >names.csv
       python FFtoGephiN.py >links.csv
